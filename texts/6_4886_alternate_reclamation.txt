Reimagining alternates to the reclamation as projected by 'The East India Company', such as deepening of channels between the breach and pydhonie as well as the breach and mahalakshmi.This alternative was actually suggested by The Company executives back in England who were discussing the pros and cons of investing in a colonial setting  where extraction of raw materialwas the main objective. Was it financially viable to invest in improving conditons in the island city by reclamation? Or should that job be left to the locals?
This map tries to reimagine the very possible alternatives put forward by the Companywallahs.
